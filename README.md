# Bank-Account-Creator---Savings-Current-

The code in this repository is a bank account system which gives user option to create accounts between two types Current and Savings. <br>
This was a question in a C plus plus book i just made a few changes to the question and made it into a program.<br>

Question : <br> <br>
          
          Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of accounts for customers, one called as savins account and the other as current account. The savings account provides interest on balance. The current account holders don't get any interest and have to maintain a minimum balance of Rs. 500. If  the balance is below Rs. 500 a fine of Rs. 150 is deducted.
         Create a class account tthat stores customer name , account number, and type of account. From this derive the classes cur_acct and sav_acct to make them more specific to their requirements. Include necessary member fuctions in order to achieve the following tasks:
         1. Accept deposit from a customer and update the balance
         2. Display the balance
         3. Compute and deposit interest.
         4. Permit withdrawl and update the balance.
         5. Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty, necessary, and hen update the balance;
         
        Do not use any constructors. Use member fuctions to initialize the class members.
